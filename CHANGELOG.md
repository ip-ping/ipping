# Changelog

Progress log for `ipping`, newest first. Each entry is one small, tested step.

## Unreleased

### 2026-11-04: CI fix
- `npm run typecheck` now generates Next's route types first (`next typegen`). It had only passed
  locally because a previous build had already created them; CI on a clean checkout caught it.

### 2026-11-04: Docker image and the full-stack compose file
- `Dockerfile` (Next.js standalone, non-root, health check) built once on the build machine and
  shared by both architectures; `sharp` is excluded because the app never uses `next/image`.
- `compose.yaml`: Caddy + frontend + backend + PostgreSQL + one-shot `migrate`, only the proxy
  publishes ports, backend and frontend run read-only with all capabilities dropped.
  `deploy/Caddyfile` flushes `/api/*` immediately (live streams) and does not compress it.
- `docker.yml` publishes `tonyliuzj/ipping` (`latest` + commit SHA) on pushes to `main`, like
  `file-node`; `ci.yml` also builds the image for both architectures.
- Verified with the whole stack in Docker and a real node connecting through the proxy: setup,
  enrollment, approval, live measurement over SSE, emergency stop, and real client addresses in the
  audit log.

### 2026-11-04: first-run setup and administration
- `/setup`: one-time creation of the administrator, gated by the setup token (printed in the backend
  log, or `IPPING_SETUP_TOKEN` from the installer).
- `/admin`: sign-in, then Nodes (approve, edit declared location and mark it verified, rotate key,
  revoke), Enrollment (single-use tokens shown once, with the enroll command), Limits & safety
  (emergency stop, probe budgets, retention, blocked targets) and the audit log.
- Verified in headless Chromium against the real backend and node: wrong setup token refused,
  token -> enroll -> approve, emergency stop blocks new measurements, rotated key cuts the old
  credential off, every action appears in the audit log.

### 2026-11-04: measure form and live results
- Home page: target input (IP, hostname or pasted URL), name-resolution mode, IP version, echo
  count and node selection; the backend's refusal reasons are shown as they are.
- Results page: progress, summary cards (responding nodes, fastest, slowest, packet loss) and the
  per-node table (min / median / avg / max / loss / status) with expandable per-echo detail.
- Live updates over Server-Sent Events: the page reads the full state, then subscribes from the
  sequence number it already has; replayed events are ignored, so reconnects never double-count.
- Node outages and deadlines are labelled as such, never as packet loss. URL input explains that ICMP
  tests the host, not the page. Share toggle (opt-in), cancel, "run again", recent list.
- Verified in headless Chromium against the real backend and the real Rust node.
- Fixed: shadcn's generated CSS pointed `--font-sans` at itself, which fell back to a serif font.

### 2026-11-04: app shell and typed API client
- Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) with shadcn/ui only for components; dark mode follows the system.
- Typed API client: types generated from a pinned copy of the backend's OpenAPI document, session
  and CSRF token handled once (with one automatic retry after a stale token).
- Public Nodes page showing approved nodes and whether each is online.
- CI: lint, typecheck, API-types-match-contract check, production build.
