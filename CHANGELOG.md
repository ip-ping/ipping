# Changelog

Progress log for `ipping`, newest first. Each entry is one small, tested step.

## Unreleased

### 2026-11-06: a nicer installer
- Guided install: pick Docker or direct, give a domain (validated, with an explanation of what HTTPS
  needs), see a summary, confirm. Nothing changes until you do.
- Progress: every step is a line with a spinner that becomes a check mark and a time; the output of
  the commands behind it goes to `/var/log/ipping-install.log` and appears only when a step fails,
  with the last lines and the log path. Packages are refreshed once, not three times.
- A summary box with the address and the setup token, the next steps, and `access` to show them again.
- `status` (services with running/stopped), `doctor` (grouped, and each failing check says what to
  try), a menu that shows the current state and returns after each action.
- Mistakes are caught early: a port that is already taken (and by which program), an invalid domain or
  `--version`, and arguments are validated before sudo is requested.
- An install that fails part-way can be run again: the "installed" marker is written only once the
  services are up, and the direct install saves its configuration (including the database password)
  as soon as the database exists. Before, a retry hit "already installed" or "role exists but its
  password is unknown".
- Plain output without a terminal (ASCII, no colour, no spinner); `NO_COLOR` honoured.
- Verified through a real terminal emulator (and in pipes) on Debian 13 machines with systemd: Docker
  and direct installs, update from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0, backup and restore, uninstall keeping data,
  reinstall, purge, and the error paths.

### 2026-11-06: fix: installing Docker on Debian 13 broke the release lookup
- The installer *sourced* `/etc/os-release` into its own shell, and that file defines `VERSION`
  (Debian 13: `13 (trixie)`). Whenever Docker had to be installed, `VERSION` became the release to
  download, giving `Could not download .../releases/download/v13 (trixie)/release-manifest.json`.
  The file is now read in a subshell (`os_release KEY`), so it can never touch the script's variables.
- `--version` is validated up front (`v1.2.3`, `latest`, `main`), so any other value is refused with a
  clear message instead of ending up inside a URL.
- Arguments are validated *before* asking for sudo, not after.
- Reproduced on a real Debian 13 machine (systemd, no Docker): v0.2.0 fails with the exact error above;
  with the fix the same machine installs Docker, fetches the right release and the whole stack comes
  up healthy.
- Why it was missed: every earlier test ran with Docker already installed, so the install-Docker branch
  never executed. `tests/installer.sh` now covers the helper (Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 fixtures), the
  version rules and the command line, and runs in CI.

### 2026-11-05: several backend processes
- `compose.yaml`, `.env.example` and `ipping.sh` (`--backend-workers N`) can run more than one backend
  process; they cooperate through PostgreSQL (see the backend README).
- Verified with the whole Docker stack and three workers behind Caddy, driven in a browser: first-run
  setup, enrollment, a live measurement streamed through the proxy, the emergency stop, and rotating a
  node's key (which closes a socket another worker may hold).

## v0.2.0 (2026-11-05)

### 2026-11-04: estimated network location
- A panel under the results table for finished measurements: the likely place, a heuristic evidence
  label (with a tooltip saying what it is not), the closest node's physical distance limit, other
  places that also fit, warnings, the measurements used, and what the method cannot tell you.
  Contradictory evidence and too little evidence are shown as such, with the reason.
- A plain SVG world map (no map library, nothing fetched at runtime): nodes that measured, the likely
  area, alternatives. The outline is generated from Natural Earth by `scripts/build-world-map.mjs`.
- API contract re-pinned to the backend that serves `/location`.
- Verified in headless Chromium against the real backend with ten synthetic nodes: a target in
  Amsterdam is placed in Amsterdam (moderate evidence), every node at ~2 ms gives "a single location
  could not be established" naming the contradiction, and a regional-DNS measurement explains why it
  cannot be estimated. Real-world accuracy is not measured (see the backend README).

### 2026-11-04: verification and hardening
- Run for real under systemd 255 (a container with systemd as PID 1): the published v0.1.0 installers
  bring up PostgreSQL, backend, frontend, Caddy and a node, a measurement completes through the
  sandboxed node, systemd restarts a killed node, all services are enabled for boot, and uninstall
  removes the units.
- Units tightened (clock, hostname, /proc, SUID, IPC, native syscalls only, private umask, no
  capabilities unless needed, a syscall filter on the node). `systemd-analyze security` exposure:
  node 5.8 -> 1.5, backend 3.5, frontend 3.5, Caddy 5.0 (it must bind low ports).
- The `CAP_NET_RAW` fallback was exercised: with unprivileged ping disabled on the host the node's unit
  keeps exactly that one capability and still measures (raw sockets).
- The installers' message for a normal user with no sudo was run (clear error, exit code 1; `--help`
  needs neither).
- Release files get signed build-provenance attestations (`gh attestation verify`), and the
  `compose.yaml` attached to a release pins that release's image tags. Both take effect with the next
  release; attestations cannot be created by a dry run.

## v0.1.0 (2026-11-04)

First release. Everything below shipped in it. Installs from the release pages work in both modes (tested in clean containers with the published artifacts).

### 2026-11-04: release tags and published installers
- [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md): semantic versions, `vX.Y.Z` tags (`-rc.N` previews), release order
  (backend, node, application), what each tag publishes, compatibility rules, how to take one back.
- `release.yml` can be started by pushing a tag or by hand (`gh workflow run release.yml -f
  version=0.1.0 -f dry_run=true`); it refuses a tag that does not match `package.json`, publishes only
  from `main`, and a dry run builds and checks everything but publishes nothing. A re-run replaces
  files instead of failing.
- `edge.yml`: every change to the installer on `main` re-uploads `ipping.sh`, `compose.yaml` and the
  `Caddyfile` to a rolling `edge` prerelease (the link-guide approach), after ShellCheck passes. It is a
  prerelease, so `releases/latest/download/ipping.sh` keeps serving the newest tagged release.
- `ipping.sh` starts itself again through sudo when run as a normal user, so the download-and-run
  one-liner in the README works as typed.

### 2026-11-04: installer lint fixes
- Fixed what the newest ShellCheck (the one on CI runners) reports: `A && B || C` chains, and a
  `grep -q` inside a pipeline under `pipefail`, which could end the "wait until the node has
  connected" loop early.

### 2026-11-04: docs
- README shows how to download `ipping.sh` from a release.

### 2026-11-04: release workflow
- `release.yml`: a `v*` tag publishes the versioned image and a GitHub release holding `ipping.sh`,
  `compose.yaml`, `Caddyfile`, the frontend bundle for direct installs, `release-manifest.json` and
  `SHA256SUMS`. The manifest is built from `release.env`, which pins the backend release this
  frontend was tested with. Linted with actionlint; **not run yet**, because no release has been
  tagged (the backend and node need theirs first).

### 2026-11-04: central installer (`ipping.sh`)
- Docker mode and direct mode (systemd, no Docker), `install` / `update` / `start` / `stop` /
  `restart` / `status` / `logs` / `doctor` / `backup` / `restore` / `uninstall`, interactive menu.
- `release-manifest.json` (see `scripts/release-manifest.sh`) pins the frontend, backend and
  node-protocol versions that were tested together; the installer never fetches "latest" parts.
- Direct mode downloads pinned uv, Node.js and Caddy (SHA-256 or SHA-512 as each publisher lists),
  installs the backend from a hash-locked requirements file, runs three unprivileged services under
  hardened units, and creates the `ipping` database and role only if they do not exist.
- Updates take a database backup first and roll back on a failed migration. Release directories are
  named by version and checksum, so an update never overwrites the release that is running.
- Tested in clean containers against the real services, both modes: install, health checks (only
  the proxy publishes ports), setup, a real node enrolling and measuring 1.1.1.1 through the
  installed stack, backup and a restore that really rolls data back, update, uninstall keeping data,
  reinstall reusing it, purge. Direct mode ran with `systemctl` shimmed (containers have no
  systemd), so the generated unit files were executed by the shim, not by systemd.
- Found and fixed while testing: published SHA-512 checksums (Caddy) were compared as SHA-256 and
  the installer correctly refused; a bundle with a 0700 top directory made the frontend unreadable
  to its service user; reinstall after a plain uninstall was blocked and would have generated a
  password that no longer matched the kept database.

### 2026-11-04: CI fix
- `npm run typecheck` now generates Next's route types first (`next typegen`). It had only passed
  locally because a previous build had already created them; CI on a clean checkout caught it.

### 2026-11-04: Docker image and the full-stack compose file
- `Dockerfile` (Next.js standalone, non-root, health check) built once on the build machine and
  shared by both architectures; `sharp` is excluded because the app never uses `next/image`.
- `compose.yaml`: Caddy + frontend + backend + PostgreSQL + one-shot `migrate`, only the proxy
  publishes ports, backend and frontend run read-only with all capabilities dropped.
  `deploy/Caddyfile` flushes `/api/*` immediately (live streams) and does not compress it.
- `docker.yml` publishes `tonyliuzj/ipping` (`latest` + commit SHA) on pushes to `main`, like
  `file-node`; `ci.yml` also builds the image for both architectures.
- Verified with the whole stack in Docker and a real node connecting through the proxy: setup,
  enrollment, approval, live measurement over SSE, emergency stop, and real client addresses in the
  audit log.

### 2026-11-04: first-run setup and administration
- `/setup`: one-time creation of the administrator, gated by the setup token (printed in the backend
  log, or `IPPING_SETUP_TOKEN` from the installer).
- `/admin`: sign-in, then Nodes (approve, edit declared location and mark it verified, rotate key,
  revoke), Enrollment (single-use tokens shown once, with the enroll command), Limits & safety
  (emergency stop, probe budgets, retention, blocked targets) and the audit log.
- Verified in headless Chromium against the real backend and node: wrong setup token refused,
  token -> enroll -> approve, emergency stop blocks new measurements, rotated key cuts the old
  credential off, every action appears in the audit log.

### 2026-11-04: measure form and live results
- Home page: target input (IP, hostname or pasted URL), name-resolution mode, IP version, echo
  count and node selection; the backend's refusal reasons are shown as they are.
- Results page: progress, summary cards (responding nodes, fastest, slowest, packet loss) and the
  per-node table (min / median / avg / max / loss / status) with expandable per-echo detail.
- Live updates over Server-Sent Events: the page reads the full state, then subscribes from the
  sequence number it already has; replayed events are ignored, so reconnects never double-count.
- Node outages and deadlines are labelled as such, never as packet loss. URL input explains that ICMP
  tests the host, not the page. Share toggle (opt-in), cancel, "run again", recent list.
- Verified in headless Chromium against the real backend and the real Rust node.
- Fixed: shadcn's generated CSS pointed `--font-sans` at itself, which fell back to a serif font.

### 2026-11-04: app shell and typed API client
- Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) with shadcn/ui only for components; dark mode follows the system.
- Typed API client: types generated from a pinned copy of the backend's OpenAPI document, session
  and CSRF token handled once (with one automatic retry after a stale token).
- Public Nodes page showing approved nodes and whether each is online.
- CI: lint, typecheck, API-types-match-contract check, production build.
